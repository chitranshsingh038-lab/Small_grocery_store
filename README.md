Grocery Store Billing System

This Python project simulates a grocery store shopping and billing system. 
Users can choose from categories like soap, vegetables, biscuits, rice, flour, chocolates, and snacks, select items, and enter quantities.
The program calculates a detailed bill, showing item-wise costs and the total amount.
It also applies a 10% discount for orders above ₹300. 
Users are greeted based on the current time of day.
All orders and bills are saved in text files under the GROSORY_STORE folder with the user’s name and purchase date. 
Input validation ensures only available items can be purchased. The system allows adding more items if the discount threshold isn’t met.
It demonstrates Python basics including lists, dictionaries, loops, functions, file handling, and time operations. 
The project runs in the console and is ideal for learning practical Python applications.
